# 3D Scanner using Triangulation Method-
3D SCANNER

# who will use my invention -
>> Modern Day softwares like SolidWorks and rendering and simulation softwares use scanned 3D models.
>> In order to achieve accurate models, techniques like triangulation are used for scanning.

# What material I have used -
1. Servo Motor
2. Arduino
3. Line Laser
4. Camera
5. Python Ide
6. Matlab Enviroment

# Working -
>> The project works on the process of triangulation. It identifies the height or position of a point or an object in arbitrary space. 
>> Line Laser is used as illumination source.
>> Building a coordinate map of a surface point-by-point is inefficient. Looking at slices or multiple slices provides a more efficient and accurate representation of the object under test. The accuracy of the coordinate map - and thus decisions made against it â€“ are related to how thin a slice you can take.
